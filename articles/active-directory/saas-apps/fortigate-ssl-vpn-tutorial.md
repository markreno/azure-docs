# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with FortiGate SSL VPN

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate FortiGate SSL VPN with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate FortiGate SSL VPN with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to FortiGate SSL VPN.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to FortiGate SSL VPN with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* FortiGate SSL VPN single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* FortiGate SSL VPN supports **SP** initiated SSO
* Once you configure FortiGate SSL VPN you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).

## Adding FortiGate SSL VPN from the gallery

To configure the integration of FortiGate SSL VPN into Azure AD, you need to add FortiGate SSL VPN from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **FortiGate SSL VPN** in the search box.
1. Select **FortiGate SSL VPN** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for FortiGate SSL VPN

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with FortiGate SSL VPN using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in FortiGate SSL VPN.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with FortiGate SSL VPN, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure FortiGate SSL VPN SSO](#configure-fortigate-ssl-vpn-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create FortiGate SSL VPN test user](#create-fortigate-ssl-vpn-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in FortiGate SSL VPN that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **FortiGate SSL VPN** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<FQDN>/remote/login`

    b. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<FQDN>/remote/saml/metadata`

    c. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://><FQDN/remote/saml/login`

    d. In the **Logout URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<FQDN>/remote/saml/logout`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL, Identifier, Reply URL and Logout URL. Contact [FortiGate SSL VPN Client support team](mailto:tac_amer@fortinet.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. FortiGate SSL VPN application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, FortiGate SSL VPN application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ------------ | --------- |
	| username | user.userprincipalname |
	| group | user.groups |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

1. On the **Set up FortiGate SSL VPN** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to FortiGate SSL VPN.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **FortiGate SSL VPN**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure FortiGate SSL VPN SSO

To configure single sign-on you will need the Base64 certificate downloaded from the SAML configuration of the FortiGate App created in your tenant earlier. In addition, you will need the URLs that you recorded during the FortiGate App creation -

- Entity ID
- Reply URL
- Logout URL
- Azure Login URL
- Azure AD Identifier
- Azure Logout URL

### Upload the Base64 Certificate to the FortiGate Appliance

1. Sign-in to the FortiGate management page
1. In the left-hand menu, click **System**
1. Under **System**, click **Certificates**
1. Click **Import -> Remote Certificate**
1. Browse to the certificate downloaded from the FortiGate App deployment in the Azure tenant, select it and click **OK**
1. Take note of the name of the certificate as it is displayed in the Certificate page of the FortiGate Management Portal. The default name would be similar to REMOTE_Cert_N where N is a number indicating the order in which remote certificates were uploaded 

### Perform FortiGate Command Line Configuration

One of the commands below will consume the Azure Logout URL which contains a question mark character (?). This cannot be configured successfully via the FortiGate Management Portal CLI Console. Instead, you will need to establish an SSH session to the FortiGate Appliance (using PuTTY or a similar tool). If your FortiGate Applicance is an Azure Virtual Machine, you can perform these steps from the Serial Console available from the Azure Portal for that Virtual Machine.

1. Establish an SSH session to your FortiGate appliance
1. Sign-in to your FortiGate appliance
1. Using the SAML URLs recorded earlier, perform the following command line configuration

   ```
    config user saml
    edit azure
    set entity-id <Entity ID>
    set single-sign-on-url <Reply URL>
    set single-logout-url <Logout URL>
    set idp-single-sign-on-url <Azure Login URL>
    set idp-entity-id <Azure AD Identifier>
    set idp-single-logout-url <Azure Logout URL>
    set idp-cert <REMOTE_Cert_N>
    set user-name username
    set group-name group
    end

   ```
**Note** The Azure Logout URL contains a ? character. This requires a special key sequence in order for it to be correctly provided to the FortiGate Serial Console. The URL is typically

   ```
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/wsfederation?wa=wsignout1.0

   ```
To provide this in the Serial Console, proceed by typing

   ```
    set idp-single-logout-url https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/wsfederation

   ```

Then type **CTRL+V**
Then paste the rest of the URL in to complete the line

   ```
    set idp-single-logout-url https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/wsfederation?wa=wsignout1.0

   ```

### Create FortiGate SSL VPN test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in FortiGate SSL VPN. Work withÂ [FortiGate SSL VPN support team](mailto:tac_amer@fortinet.com) to add the users in the FortiGate SSL VPN platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the FortiGate SSL VPN tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the FortiGate SSL VPN for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).

In practice, we recommend using the VPN client provided by Fortinet - FortiClient. This provides the best end user experience.
